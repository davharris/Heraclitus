#' Online sample mean and sample variance computation
#'
#' \emph{The river where you set your foot just now is gone â€“ those waters
#' giving way to this, now this.} ---Heraclitus
#'
#' A \code{moment_stream} object is an \code{\link[R6]{R6}} object with
#' reference semantics. Rather than calculating the mean and variance on a
#' complete data set, which is difficult when the data does not fit in memory
#' or when only parts of it are available, \code{moment_stream}s use Welford's
#' online algorithm to calculate these values during a single pass through the
#' data (which can then be discarded if no other summary statistics are needed).
#'
#' A stream can be monitored by creating an object with
#' \code{stream_name = moment_stream$new()}, and the mean and variance can be
#' calculated as new data comes in using \code{stream_name$update(x)}. The
#' sample mean is stored in \code{stream_name$m} and the sample variance is
#' stored in \code{stream_name$v_hat}.
