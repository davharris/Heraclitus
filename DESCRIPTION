Version: 0.1.0
Author: David J. Harris
Maintainer: David J. Harris <dave@harris-research.me>
Description: Compute the mean and variance of a data stream as it is made 
    available, without storing the entire stream. Welford's one-pass algorithm
    is used for computing the variance in a numerically stable way. Some code 
    has been translated from the 'StreamStats.jl' package by John Myles White.
